        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTLM is one of the cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigatethe webpage.</li>
          <li>We use a series of of HTML elements to define the  content and framework. These HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing ag represented with an angle brackets (< >).
          </li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are case-sensitive. However declarations are not case-sensitive.</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
            <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
            <li>Three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>CSS box model, each box consists of mrgins outside the element, and the element's border, padding, and content.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git add A-: to add starter code to current working branch. Add command adds modifications in the current working branch, A- indicatesthat we want to add all changes.</li>
          <li>staging area: informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit.</li>
          <li>git commit: command with a commit message that describes what the commit contains. EX. git commit -m "add starter code"</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work.</li>
          <li>git push: pushes the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch</li>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>To declare a variable we use the var keyword, after the var keyword we give the variable a name. Finally we use an assignment operator to assignthe specific data that we want stored in our variable. We always end it with a semicolon</li>
          <li>Console.log method is used to output a message to the wev console by adding an argument.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and order counts. We must be intentional about how we set up code in a JS file.</li>
          <li>Control flow can be interrupted, however we can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed.</li>
          <li>There are truthy and falsy values in JS</li>
          <li>values 0,-0.On,"",null,undefined,NaN, or Boolean data type with the value of false are considered falsy. </li>
          <li>All other values are considered truthy</li>
          <li>Arrays is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
          <li>The location of the data item in the arrayis identified with a unique number called an index.</li>
          <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential.</li>
          <li>Function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Functions do not automatically execute when the JS file is run, you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
